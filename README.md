# UGHE Data Analysis courses

To get started, we need to first download and install a `Python` coding environment with the necessary tools to get you started on your data analysis journey.

For this course, we will use the Anaconda distribution. You can download and install it here: [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

To get started with this course navigate to `01_intro-to-data-vis` and download both files inside it. Then open them up!
