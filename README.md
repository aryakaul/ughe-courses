# UGHE Data Analysis courses

## Course 1 - Intro. to Data Visualization

### Step 1 - Download and install Anaconda

To get started, we need to first download and install a `Python` coding environment with the necessary tools to get you started on your data analysis journey.

For these courses, we will use the Anaconda distribution. 

You can download and install it here: [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

Your installation wizard might vary depending on if you're using a Mac or Windows machine, but after installing and opening the `Anaconda-Navigator` app you should get to a screen that looks like this:

First, navigate to the `Environments` tab and find one that says `base` (if you have two like me, select the one that says `base (root)`). Click it, and then in the search bar search for `xlrd` click on the first one that pops up and go through the process of installing it.

After that, go back to the `Home` tab and click on the button to Launch a `JupyterLab` environment.

### Step 2 - Download the course materials

Once you launch the `JupyterLab` environment you should find yourself in a web browser that looks something like this:

Leave that tab open, and now open a new tab to this [link](https://github.com/aryakaul/ughe-courses/tree/main/01_intro-to-data-vis). You should find a page that looks like this:

First, click on the file labeled `tutorial.ipynb`, and `Download the raw file`. The download button is a downwards arrow on the top right:

Next, do the same procedure for the file labeled `african-health-emigration_clemens-pettersson-2006.xls`. After downloading both files, move them to a different folder that you want to do the workshop in. In my case, I'm putting them in a folder on my `Desktop` labeled `ughe-courses`.

### Step 3 - Open tutorial

Go back to the `JupyterLab` tab in your browser and use the file browser to navigate to whichever folder you put the course materials in. Then double click on the file `tutorial.ipynb`.

If all went well you should open it to find yourself in a `JupyterLab` notebook! Congrats! You are now ready for the seminar! You can find a nice beginner's tutorial [here](https://hyperskill.org/blog/post/jupyter-notebook-a-complete-how-to-tutorial), but we will go over everything after this together!

To get started with this course navigate to `01_intro-to-data-vis` and download both files inside it. Then open them up!
